abstract: " Air pollution constitutes a major health risk : WHO (World Health
  Organization) estimates that it contributes to 7 million premature deaths per
  year. Our study aims to evaluate its effects on mortality in the Rhone
  department (France). It focuses on the measurements of some dangerous
  pollutants, and demonstrates a significant correlation with air pollution.
  Indeed, the link between the two phenomena follows a positive linear trend. We
  end up with a ρ2 = 0.44 for NO2, meaning that 44 % of the mortality is linked
  to the pollution in NO2. In addition, we were able to show that an increase of
  1% of this pollutant induces an increase in mortality of 0.87%. As a result,
  these results constitute an argument for reducing the use of fossil fuels."
