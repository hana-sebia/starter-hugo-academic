This project is developped to provide a simulation of a scrabble party based on the faster algorithm for generating every possible move given a set of tiles and a position. The algorithm is proposed by Steven a.gordon and uses the GADDAG data structure (Directed Acyclic Graph, prefixed by its own reverse). To have more details, refer to the pdf in attachement.
