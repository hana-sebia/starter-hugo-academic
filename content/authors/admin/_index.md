Ph.D. candidate at the French research institute Inria. I am working on machine learning for high-dimensional healthcare data analytics. My research interests include computational phenotyping and predictive analysis for large-scale electronic health records (EHR) data. I obtained the master degree in Data Science from the computer science department of Claude Bernard Lyon 1 University.
