Ph.D. candidate at the French national research institute Inria. My research focuses on machine learning for healthcare data, combining structured clinical data and medical imaging. I work on temporal phenotyping from high-dimensional electronic health records (EHR) using tensor factorization methods, as well as on medical image analysis. In particular, I develop deep learning models for vascular segmentation, modality transfer, and super-resolution in functional ultrasound (fUS) imaging. My goal is to design interpretable and efficient models that support data-driven discovery and decision-making in both clinical and preclinical settings.
